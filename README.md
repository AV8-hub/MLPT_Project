Project for the course Machine Learning for Portfolio Management and Trading


Our approach revolves around establishing an Equity strategy aimed at investing across five key sectors (Banking, Real Estate, Automobile, Energy, Tourism), as opposed to focusing solely on individual enterprises. Moreover, alongside employing a traditional Markowitz model as our baseline, we leverage a signal derived from sentiment analysis of Beige Book reports (National Summary and New York), with the purpose of enhancing the optimal allocation strategy to favor sectors endorsed as robust by the U.S. government.
